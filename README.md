# Propensity-Score-Matching


Propensity score matching (PSM) is used to estimate the effect of a treatment by accounting for the covariates. 

It attempts to balance the treatment groups on the confounding factors to make them comparable so that we can draw conclusions about the impact of a treatment on the outcome using the data.

The analysis is performed using the matchIt R package.
